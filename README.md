# Git Panda

**Desktop application that reminds you to commit your code to git**

I made this application for 2 main reasons.

1. A little while ago I accidentally threw my shiny new Macbook Pro down the stairs on my way to lunch. I soon realized that I had about 4-5 different projects with uncommitted changes on there and if the computer was to go to Apple heaven so could a weeks worth of work. Thankfully I was able to use the computer when I plugged it to an external monitor (the screen was destoyed) and the first thing I did was cd-ing into all my projects and:

```bash

$ git add .
$ git commit -m '.....'
$ git push

```

2. I have wanted to try out Electron for a while now (Spoiler: Its awesome!)
