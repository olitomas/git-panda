# How does it work ?
1. You tell Git Panda what projects to look out for.
2. You decide how frequently you want Git Panda to remind you (Default: every 4 hours).
3. If you have uncommited code in any of your projects then your operating system will notify you.

## I made this application for 2 main reasons.

### 1. I really needed it
A little while ago I accidentally threw my shiny new Macbook Pro down the stairs on my way to lunch. I soon realized that I had about 4-5 different projects with uncommitted changes on there and if the computer was to go to Apple heaven so could a weeks worth of work. Thankfully I was able to use the computer when I plugged it to an external monitor (the screen was destoyed) and the first thing I did was cd-ing into all my projects and:

```bash
$ git add .
$ git commit -m '.....'
$ git push
```

No matter how many times I tell my self I am going to commit my code many times a day I always end up forgetting.

### 2. I have wanted to try out Electron for a while now (Spoiler: Its awesome!)
